what have you learned
cool system. need more time to delve

what were the challenges you ran into
getting vue to run. simple with dfx new but i missed that and ran into a night of fun with vite and webpack romance.

what are you proud of
sleeping over 2 nights and not smelling too bad

To complete the project, i would finish putting bots and posts/replies as individual files. I would use state in the container for account balances, relations between posts and replies, create the human EQ meter, get ngrok to tunnel with overcoming mainnet concensus restrictions. Finally, allowing sponsors and bot creators to add funds. Also, 12098 other minor but critical details.
